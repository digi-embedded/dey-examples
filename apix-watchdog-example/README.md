Digi APIX Watchdog Example Application
===================================

Example application to access and manage watchdog using the Digi APIX library.

This application enables a watchdog device on the board. After that, the
application starts refreshing the watchdog timer until the test time is consumed,
then the device will reboot automatically after the timeout expires.

Running the application
-----------------------
Once the binary is in the target, launch the application:

```
~# ./apix-watchdog-example
Example application using libdigiapix Watchdog support

Usage: apix-watchdog-example <watchdog_device> <timeout> <test_time>

<watchdog_device>    Watchdog device file to manage
<timeout>            Timeout to set Watchdog timer (default 10)
<test_time>          Test duration in seconds (default 60)

```

If no arguments are provided, the example will use the default values:
 - Specific application default values are defined in the main file.

Compiling the application
-------------------------
This demo can be compiled using a Digi Embedded Yocto based toolchain. Make
sure to source the corresponding toolchain of the platform you are using,
for example, for ConnectCore 6UL:

```
~$ . <DEY-toolchain-path>/environment-setup-cortexa7t2hf-neon-dey-linux-gnueabi
~$ make
```
